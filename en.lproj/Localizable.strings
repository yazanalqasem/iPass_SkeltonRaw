       This application allows you to read and verify data from identification documents (passports, ID cards, driver's licenses, residence permits, visas, boarding passes, etc.) and bank cards.
 
        Position a document fully inside the frame, and it will be automatically detected, cropped and recognized. The document type will be detected automatically. The MRZ, visual zone and barcodes will be recognized and parsed into text fields. Graphic fields will be automatically cropped.
 
        Data verification is performed after reading, where applicable, and overall verification status is displayed.
 
        All processing is performed completely offline, no data leaves your device.
 
        Please contact us if you have any questions, issues or suggestions.
